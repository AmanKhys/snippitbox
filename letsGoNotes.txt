curl using /?, /= when i write just ? or =
io.Writer interface
type Writer interface {
	Write(p []byte) (n int, err error)
}

---------templates---------------
receiving template Set
Executing templates
{{template "example" .}}
{{block "example" .}}
relative path from where the go run is executed
reading files from disc...later gonna use embed package to embed the files in the go program


-------file serving--------------
stripPrefix before using fileServer handler 
to help the file server look into the correct directory.
eg:- 

when looking for /css/styles.css inside fsd 
1. url: "/static/" fsd: "./ui/static" ;fs looks at ./ui/static/static/css/styles.css to serve files (fsd:fileServer directory)
2. url: "/" fsd: "./ui/static"; fs looks at ./ui/static/css/styles.css to serve files(with the help of StripPrefix)


--------handler interface---------
anything with ServeHTTP method
http.HandleFunc uses http.HandlerFunc(handlerFunction) and then makes the function to a handler with ServeHTTP method and gives back the handler to the 
http.HandleFunc("/", f)
same as 
http.Handle("/", http.HandlerFunc(f))
- servemux is a special handler with ServeHTTP which calls other handler's ServeHTTP according to the url.
by chaining all the handlers in the program and serving it accordingly
- all handlers work concurrentl: all incoming HTTP requests are
served in their own goroutiney
